    <!-- Well done, Kelly.  Your game works well and follows all
the requirements.  Your code is nicely commented, and you added
a nice GUI.  While this wasn't required, you could have added some validation to ensure the user entered good data in the prompt.
It turned out that your logic in whoWins() didn't account for 
bad data entered in and defaults to the user winning if the data
didn't match what you were looking for.  Other than that, every
thing was great.
